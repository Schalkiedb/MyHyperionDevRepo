            How to build a gaming PC
        </h1>
    </div>
   
    <p>Learning to build a a PC from scratch is easier than you think. It mostly comes down to picking the correct
        components, cable management and being carefull with your components. Using the correct safety measures while
        doing so.
    </p>
    <p>
        Before staring we need to ensure that you have all the basic components. This includes items such has:
    <ul>
        <li>Cpu</li>
        <li>Ram</li>
        <li>Motherboard</li>
        <li>Graphics card</li>
        <li>Storage</li>
        <li>Power supply</li>
        <li>Case</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        You can find more information on where to buy computer component from reputable computer shops that sell these items. In the following link:

    <h2>
        1. Prepare your PC case
    </h2>
    <p>
        The first thing you'll want to do is strip the case down as far as you can go. Remove every panel that you can, and place screws in safe place you will need it afterwards to close up the case.
    </p>

    <h2>
        2. Install your fans
    </h2>
    <p>
        If you've purchased some replacement or extra cooling fans, now is the time to install them where you need them. Try to keep your cooling setup balanced, so there's as much air being drawn in as is being blown out. In case you're not sure which way the wind will go, the plastic fan guards usually denote where the air will come through.
    </p>
    <p>
        Typically you want two fans in the front drawing air in and at least one in the rear blowing air out.
    </p>

    <h2>
        3. Install the motherboard
    </h2>
    <p>
        Before you get to install the motherboard. Check for pre-installed motherboard standoffs, ensure the number and arrangement of them conforms to the holes found on your motherboard.
    </p>
    <p>
        Find your motherboard's rear I/O shield, and push it into the rectangular slot in the back of your PC case. Make sure it's right side up by matching the pattern of cutouts to the arrangement of ports on the back of your motherboard.
    </p>
    <p>
        Next, lay your motherboard down inside the chassis - carefully lining up its rear ports with the corresponding holes in the I/O shield you just installed - on top of the standoffs installed in your chassis.
    </p>
    <p>
        Then it's a simple case of securing the motherboard down with the screws that came with your chassis. Make sure you use the right ones here, as you don't want to thread the standoffs, in case you need to remove it at a later date.
    </p>

    <h2>
        4. Install your memory
    </h2>
    <p>
       Push down the latches at both ends of the Ram slots on your motherboard. Then line up the notch on the bottom of the memory with the notch in the slot. After that, you can install the memory by carefully pushing down both sides of the memory into the slot. You should hear a clicking sound as the memory secures into place and the latches click back up. 
    </p>

    <h2>
        5. Install your CPU
    </h2>
    <p>
        Here's the last complicate piece in the PC building process, Open the socket on the motherboard. 
    </p>
    <p>
        For the most recent Intel and AMD platforms, that's done by pushing down on the metal lever on the right side and moving it slightly away from the socket. You'll need to move the lever out from under the piece of metal holding it down, and slowly lift the bar all the way up and away from the socket. On older AMD AM4 motherboards, the bar is smaller, held down by a plastic clip, and has less resistance. But the bar-lifting process is similar. 
    </p>
    <p>
        On Intel and current AMD boards, you'll then need to lift the silver metal CPU retention plate up and away from the socket, the same way you lifted the metal bar but on the opposite end of the socket. Note that, if your motherboard is brand-new, there should be a plastic piece in the center of the retention plate, designed to protect the socket. You can pop this out now or leave it in until you actually install the CPU, when it will be forced out by the CPU. Hang onto this protective cover if you think there's a chance you might want to store, sell, or give away the motherboard at some later date because it's important to protect those socket pins.
    </p>
    <p>
        Don't mess this bit up unless you want to destroy your components! Before grabbing your CPU, look on the socket or the retention plate for a small triangle / arrow in one of the corners. Usually, it's in the upper left (AMD) or lower left (Intel). Once you've located the arrow indicator for the socket, check your CPU for a matching arrow in one of its corners. 
    </p>
    <p>
        You need to make sure the triangular arrow on your CPU lines up in the same corner as the same arrow on your CPU socket or retention plate. If you clamp your CPU down with these arrows misaligned, you will damage your motherboard, likely your CPU, and possibly other components if you power the system up with the CPU installed this way.
    </p>

    <p>
       Place your cpu into the socet making sure that the triangles are a match.
       Next would be to do the steps listed above of unlocking in reverse. 
       This would be pushing the lever down and placing it into the metal piece
    </p>
    <p>
        Add thermal paste and your cooler of choice
     </p>

    <h2>
        6. Install your storage
    </h2>
    <p>
        Most modern PC cases comes with SSD bays of some sort. But if you're case doesn't, the 3.5-inch drive caddies typically reserved for hard drives should have compatible mounting points. No matter what type of storage drive you're installing, ensure the connection ports are facing towards a cable cut-out inside your chassis as it will make routing cables easier.
    </p>

    <img src="Images\power.png" alt="" style="height: 300px; width: 500px;" class="center">
    <h2>
        7. Position and install power supply
    </h2>
    <p>
        If your PC case comes with a PSU bracket, remove it ahead of time and attach it to the back of the unit. Next up thread the cables through the PSU slot in the back of the case first, and then slide the PSU into place, securing the bracket back onto the chassis. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Otherwise, on older cases you'll have to slip in the power supply in through the inside of the chassis and push it firmly against the inside wall as you attach it with four screws. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Depending on the design of your case, you'll want to orient the fan towards ventilation areas built into it. For most cases we suggest facing the fan downwards or to the side away from the interior of your PC. This way, your PSU can draw in fresh air and exhaust heat through the back.
    </p>

    <h2>
        8. Connect everything to your motherboard
    </h2>
    <p>
        To get your front I/O power buttons working properly, you need to plug in the correct cables.
    </p>
    <p>
        For everyone else, take the individual pins, and, using the motherboard installation handbook, identify which pins and cables need connecting. Try to do this part gently do, so as to not to bend the pins. It's important to note that any LED lights (HDD and Power), need to be oriented correctly, with the + and - cables installed into the + and - pins on the board.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's also a good time to plug in your USB 3.0 header, USB 2.0 header, and audio passthrough. Audio is located on the bottom left of most motherboards. It will be labeled, and the pinouts will be different to the USB 2.0 headers. Install your USB 3.0 cables (denoted with a blue-colored end) into any available slots on the board, making sure to line up the pins with the holes in the USB 3.0 cables.
    </p>

    <h2>
        9. Connect your power supply
    </h2>
    <p>
        Now you can plug in the rest of your power cables. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Identify your 8-pin EPS cable, and slide it up the back of the chassis, through the cable grommet and plug it into the 8 pin power slot at the top of the motherboard. Then, find the bulkier 24-pin cable, slide that through any cable routing recesses on the chassis and plug it into the corresponding 24-pin ATX power port on the motherboard. 

    </p>
    <p>
        Next up, take your SATA power and connect it to any storage drives. If you happen to have something mounted onto the front of the case, run this SATA power cable through the PSU shroud, appropriate grommets or holes, and into your front-mounted 2.5-inch drive. This is a good opportunity to plug in the SATA Data cables between any storage drives and the motherboard as well. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Lastly, you'll want to thread your PCIe power cable through the cutout in the PSU cover or any side grommets/holes, so that it's ready for when you install your GPU
    </p>

    <h2>
        10. Installing your graphics card
    </h2>
    <p>
       Locate the PCIe slot closest to your processor. From there locate the two PCIe slots next to where you'll want to install your GPU. Remove any screws on the PCIe slot covers.
    </p>
    <p>
        Take your graphics card out of the anti-static bag and line it up with the slots we just opened up. The rear I/O on the GPU should be facing out the back of the chassis. Once the gold contacts on your GPU make are touching the PCIe slot, gently push it into place until you hear a click. Then use the same screws we removed from the PCIe slot cover to secure the GPU into place.
    </p>
    <p>
        Plug in your PCIe power that you routed in with our last step - and we have a fully built PC.
